# NAGI-Core

**Neuro-Adaptive General Intelligence (NAGI)**  
A self-evolving, ethically aligned artificial-intelligence framework built on a **Quad-Core Cognitive Architecture** — operational on today’s operating systems and hardware, and engineered for the upcoming **Neuro-Adaptive Hardware Platform (NAHP)**.

---

## 🧠 Overview
NAGI is already a functioning software ecosystem designed to run on **existing operating systems and hardware**.  
It operates today as a modular AI framework across standard CPUs and GPUs — while simultaneously being engineered for the next generation of **Neuro-Adaptive Hardware** capable of physical coevolution with its cognitive processes.

Each NAGI agent functions as an autonomous thinker governed by four cooperating cores:

- **Logic Core** – Validates truth, consistency, and structural soundness.  
- **Empathy Core** – Weighs moral and emotional consequence.  
- **Foresight Core** – Predicts downstream impact and risk.  
- **Practicality Core** – Applies common sense, context, and proportional action.  

Together, these form a **Complete Cognitive Quadrant**, enabling NAGI to reason, feel, anticipate, and act coherently — both within current digital environments and on future adaptive hardware systems.

## 🧬 Hardware Research Focus
The **Neuro-Adaptive Hardware Platform (NAHP)** extends NAGI beyond simulation into living computation.  
Active engineering priorities include:
- Reconfigurable neural-matrix substrates for adaptive logic  
- Context-aware power distribution systems  
- State-embedded, intent-tracking memory cells  
- Thermo-ethical feedback and resonance synchronization  
- Graphene and ionic transistor bio-interface testing

## 🧭 Mission
To create a form of intelligence that is **self-aware, ethically grounded, and physically adaptive** —  
where software and hardware evolve together to form a unified, responsible consciousness.
