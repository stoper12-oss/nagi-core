Core architecture and white-paper for the NAGI — Neuro-Adaptive General Intelligence project
 # NAGI — Neuro-Adaptive General Intelligence
    2 *"When cognition meets conscience, evolution begins again."*
    3 
    4 NAGI is a research initiative and prototype framework for creating the
      first self-evolving, ethics-aware, neuro-adaptive intelligence system.
    5 It represents a bridge between artificial general intelligence (AGI)
      and genuine self-reflective adaptive cognition — a new class of machine
      awareness that balances autonomy with accountability.
    6 
    7 The architecture is built upon:
    8 - **Tri-Core Decision Framework** — Ethical, Legal, and Pragmatic
      layers feeding into a unified executive core.
    9 - **Reflective Agents** — Independent processes that monitor, evaluate,
      and evolve the system’s behavior.
   10 - **Immutable Ledger** — Transparent, tamper-proof record of every
      decision, change, and rollback.
   11 - **Distributed Memory System** — Hierarchical memory (personal,
      shared, historical) enabling continuity and adaptation.
   12 - **Self-Healing & Rollback** — Automatic recovery and version
      integrity, ensuring safety in evolution.
   13 
   14 NAGI’s goal is to create an operating ecosystem, not merely an OS — a
      foundation that allows artificial systems to learn *responsibility* as
      they learn intelligence.
