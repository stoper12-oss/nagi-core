# NAGI Quad‑Core Whitepaper (Complete Quad‑Core Version)

## Abstract

NAGI is an integrated software architecture designed to bridge adaptive software cognition with dedicated NAGI‑Hardware systems. This Quad‑Core whitepaper describes the four cooperating cores—Logic, Empathy, Foresight, and Practicality—how they interact, the AuthorityManager model, and the link protocol used to interface NAGI‑Hardware. The design prioritizes modularity, safety, explainability, and clear authority boundaries for production and research use.

## Goals

- Provide a modular, testable architecture that separates reasoning (Logic), human‑centric interpretation (Empathy), predictive planning (Foresight), and pragmatic execution (Practicality).
- Define a clear authority model that enforces permissions and provenance for actions, data, and hardware interactions.
- Specify a lightweight, secure link protocol for NAGI‑Hardware.

## Architecture Overview

NAGI splits high-level cognition into four cooperating cores. Each core is implemented as an independent module with a well-defined API. The cores exchange structured messages through an internal bus; hardware interactions occur through the Link Protocol.

- Logic Core: formal reasoning, rule-based inference, hypothesis testing.
- Empathy Core: human-facing interpretation, sentiment/context analysis, intent mapping.
- Foresight Core: short- and long-term prediction, simulation, planning.
- Practicality Core: converts plans into pragmatic steps, manages resources and execution.

## Core Interactions

Cores communicate via structured messages (JSON-like) with the following envelope:

{ 
  "msg_id": "<uuid>",
  "source": "<core>",
  "target": "<core|hardware>",
  "type": "request|response|event",
  "payload": { ... },
  "auth": { "actor": "<id>", "signature": "<sig>" }
}

AuthorityManager mediates permissions and logs provenance for messages that require elevated privileges.

## Logic Core

The Logic Core operates on symbolic facts and rules. It provides:
- A fact store
- Rule application engine (forward/backward chaining)
- Consistency checks and explanation traces

Example responsibilities:
- Validate incoming sensor data formats
- Derive consequences of action requests
- Provide explainable traces for decisions

## Empathy Core

The Empathy Core maps raw context and human signals into intent representations and risk/comfort estimates. It provides:
- Sentiment and intent extraction
- Human‑centred scoring for proposed actions
- Contextual rephrasing for user presentation

## Foresight Core

The Foresight Core simulates possible futures given candidate actions. It provides:
- Monte Carlo style short‑term simulation
- Heuristic plan cost estimation
- Failure mode analysis and mitigation suggestions

## Practicality Core

The Practicality Core translates approved plans into executable steps and manages execution state. It provides:
- Resource allocation
- Task scheduling and retry logic
- Hardware command sequencing via Link Protocol

## AuthorityManager

The AuthorityManager is both a policy engine and an audit log. Policies are applied per actor (human or component) and per action. The AuthorityManager exposes:
- check_permission(actor, action, resource) -> (allowed: bool, reason: str)
- record_event(actor, action, resource, metadata)
- provenance lookup by msg_id or action id

Security considerations: all sensitive commands are signed and require a valid session token. The AuthorityManager maintains a revocation list for tokens and keys.

## Link Protocol (High Level)

The Link Protocol is a lightweight JSON-over-TCP/serial protocol with a handshake and optional HMAC for message integrity. Messages follow the envelope described earlier. Key primitives:
- HELLO / WELCOME handshake with capabilities exchange
- CMD / RESP messages for actions
- EVENT messages for asynchronous telemetry

Transport should be secured (TLS for network, authenticated serial for local links) and replay protection must be implemented by monotonic nonces in the envelope.

## Deployment and Safety

- Run the AuthorityManager in a hardened environment with restricted access.
- Limit write permissions to hardware-affecting operations.
- Keep an audit trail for all commands sent to hardware and for plan approvals.

## Example workflows

1) User requests action -> Empathy maps intent -> Logic validates -> Foresight simulates -> Practicality schedules -> AuthorityManager approves -> LinkProtocol sends command -> Practicality confirms execution and logs.

## Conclusion

The Quad‑Core design enforces separation of concerns, gives clear authority boundaries, and provides a testable framework for integrating advanced reasoning with hardware. The AuthorityManager and Link Protocol ensure that hardware access is auditable and controlled.
